# EDA-projects-on-different-datasets

In this repo, you can find the EDA on different real time datasets. 
  > At first, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a set of techniques that were developed by Tukey, John Wilder in 1970. The theory after this procedure was to analyze the data before developing a model. Today Data scientists and analysts spend most of their time in Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
# What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
>Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is applied to take insights from the data. Data Scientists and Analysts attempt to find various patterns, relations, and anomalies in the data using some statistical graphs and different visualization techniques. Following things are part of EDA :
   > 1) Get the best insights from a data set
   > 2) Uncover underlying structure
   > 3) Evoke important variables from the dataset
   > 4) Identify outliers (if any)
   > 5) Test underlying theories

>Here you can find detailed process of EDA on different datasets.
